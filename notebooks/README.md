Goal of this repository is to have implementations of core statistical/ machine learning algorithms in one place.
I have tried to give a comprehensive overview with mathematical foundation in the notebooks. Code being purely in **Numpy** with a few exceptions in certain cases that involve use of **Scikit-learn** or **pandas** with **matplotlib**

1. [KNN](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhijeetdtu/ml-scratch/blob/master/notebooks/1_Knn.ipynb)
2. [Perceptron](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhijeetdtu/ml-scratch/blob/master/notebooks/2_perceptron.ipynb)
3. [Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhijeetdtu/ml-scratch/blob/master/notebooks/3_MLE.ipynb)
4. [Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent](https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhijeetdtu/ml-scratch/blob/master/notebooks/4_logistic_regression_gradient_descent.ipynb)
